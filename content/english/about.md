Hello! I'm Yogesh Ingale, a DevOps Engineer with more than 7 years of experience in AWS cloud, DevOps, and Python automation. Based in Mumbai, India, I've had the opportunity to work on projects in Brazil, Hungary and Australia, delivering high-quality solutions to top pharmaceutical companies.

I'm proficient in container technologies such as Docker and AWS ECS, and skilled in managing cloud infrastructure using Terraform and CloudFormation. My AWS services knowledge includes ECS, EC2, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, and more. I have extensive expertise in CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Travis CI, Jenkins, and AWS CodePipeline.

My primary programming language is Python, complemented by shell scripting, and I have experience with databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB.
